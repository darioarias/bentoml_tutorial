# BentoML Tutorial

## Purpose

Since BentoML is OS, I want to start contributing to the source code. Before I can start contributing, I want to have some idea about the Infrastructure. As a result, I am following their tutorial to get a version of the project up and running so I can test it and learn the project structure.

This repo will serve as notes for my journey using the BentoML Tutorial, something I can look at later.
